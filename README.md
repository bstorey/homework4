Homework4

Part 1
- Each of these classes are missing their constructors, fill them in where the comments have indicated

Solution: For each of the classes, I created multiple constructors based off of the requested parameters in the java file.

Part 2
- This assignment compiles and runs without additional work. However, the assignment requires you to refactor the existing code to use the principles introduced in its respective checkpoint. ASSIGNMENT: Modify Appliance such that it uses a static copy of PowerSupply

Solution: In Appliances.java, I changed the mPowerSupply object to a private static object.

Part 3
- Open your command prompt and cd into this README's directory (Part 3/interfaces). Populate three separate interfaces: Driver.java, Skydiver.java and SalsaDancer.java. Have the three people classes (Albert.java, Mary.java, John.java) implement the appropriate interfaces as expected by Main.java. 

Solution: I defined the interface methods specified in each of the interfaces. for the classes, I implemented the interfaces and created methods based off of the interfaces. 

Part 4
- This assignment compiles and runs without additional work. However, the assignment requires you to refactor the existing code to use the principles introduced in its respective checkpoint. ASSIGNMENT: Replace the operations below by employing polymorphism

Solution: I created a Pet array with all of the different pet objects (cat, dog, etc) in it. I then ran a "for each" loop that ran the different methods for each object. Since all of the objects extended Pet, no separate actions were needed.
